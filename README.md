# sciter zepto demo app

This is a [sciter.js](https://sciter.com/) demo app that explores the use of [zepto](https://zeptojs.com/).

## rationale

jQuery does not work in Sciter as JQuery was designed to support specific browsers. Zepto is a minimalist JavaScript library with a largely jQuery-compatible API. If you use jQuery, you already know how to use Zepto.

## get started

- git clone the repository
- run `install.bat` to download the latest sciter binaries and library
- start `scapp.exe`
- to refresh the app after changes to the html/css click `F5`

## debug app

- start `inspector.exe`
- inside the `scapp.exe` window click `CTRL + SHIFT + I` to connect to the inspector
- click `CTRL + SHIFT + left click` to inspect an element
