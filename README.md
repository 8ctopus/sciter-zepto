# sciter zepto demo app

This is a [sciter.js](https://sciter.com/) demo app that explores the use of [zepto](https://zeptojs.com/) as a jQuery alternative.

jQuery does not work in Sciter as jQuery was designed to support specific browsers. Zepto is a minimalist JavaScript library with a largely jQuery-compatible API. If you use jQuery, you already know how to use Zepto.
